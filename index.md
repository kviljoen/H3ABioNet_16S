  Collaborative Notes

  If you want to use an Etherpad, go to:

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.
{% endcomment %}
{% if page.collaborative_notes %}

{% comment %}
  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the

  <h3>R</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.

        Install R by downloading and running

        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as 
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, 
        for example when installing R packages.
